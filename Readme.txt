I made this game in Unreal in 48 hours. This was my very first time using the engine.

Art assets and animations were imported from various sources, but all code and level design was made by myself. The project you can see is quite unfinished. I wasn't able to get animations fully working when I ran out of time.

Decided not to try and put the actual files on github. I accidentally imported all of my textures in 8K, so the filesize was absolutely enormous.
